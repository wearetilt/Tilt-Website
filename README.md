# :ghost: Development Installation

---
  
---

## :ghost: Dependencies

To install this project you must have already installed on your machine.

- PHP 7.4
- Docker https://www.docker.com/community-edition
- Ports required to be open on your machine, 80, 8443, 33061

---

## :ghost: `Setup`


Pull the repository locally to your development machine. There are 2 bash scripts `start.sh` and `stop.sh`.

To start the project run `./start.sh`. This script will do several things:

- To configure your system to use NFS (which should provide speed improvements in Docker), run `./start.sh --n`
- To set your environment (development/staging/production) run `./start.sh --e=[ENVIRONMENT]`
- If run as `./start.sh --c` then the `dbdata`, and the docker images will be rebuilt.
- Create a `.env` file if one does not exist, based off of the `.env.example` file.
- Start the docker containers to serve up the project locally.
- Create the default database if it does not exist.
- Add `config/certs/server.crt` to your machines trusted certificates to allow SSO testing.

Once the script completes, the project will be running.
- Web server will be available on https://localhost/
- MySQL server on localhost:33061

To stop the project from running, run `./stop.sh`. You can run this script as `stop.sh -c` this will force deletion of your docker containers and images, creating a rebuild on the next build.

:exclamation: **WARNING! `./stop.sh -c` will remove all unused docker images from your system, be sure you want to do this before using the -c flag.** :exclamation:

You'll need to import the database to your local db and configure your wp-config settings accordingly. Docker settings are as follows:
- DB Host: Tilt-Website_database
- DB Name: homestead
- DB User: homestead
- DB Password: secret

## :bug: `PhpStorm and Xdebug`

Setting up this project with Docker will also include the setup of Xdebug in the Docker app container, and will enable it, so no additional Xdebug setup will be required. Xdebug is best used in conjunction with PhpStorm, which will require a bit of configuration.

### :bug: Configuring PhpStorm:

#### :bug: Configure port to listen to:

- Open PhpStorm
- Go to Preferences > Debug
- Go to the Xdebug section
- Change the Debug Port to 9001

### :bug: Debugging:

If you've done the above correctly, CONGRATS, you're ready to start debugging with PhpStorm.

#### :bug: Start debugging!:
- Stick a breakpoint in the root index.php file by clicking on the margin next to the line you want to stop at:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80678577/111811273-ca15d100-88ce-11eb-888f-39d95698ef7a.png)
- Start listening for connections by clicking the following button in the toolbar:

- Visit `https://localhost`
- The page shouldn't load
- Go back to PhpStorm
- The code should be paused on the chosen breakpoint, with the line it's stopped on highlighted in blue
- Go to the 'Debug' window (fig. 1 below), and open the 'Debugger' tab (fig. 2 below)
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80678577/111812675-44932080-88d0-11eb-9971-fb25cc6d86e2.png)
- You should be able to see all variables available in the current scope at the point that you put the breakpoint (fig. 3 above)
- From here, you can step through the code using the various controls available in the 'Debug' window in the above screenshot

#### :bug: Stop debugging!:
- Stop listening for connections by clicking the following button in the toolbar:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80678577/111811749-490b0980-88cf-11eb-899d-236345de9b27.png)
